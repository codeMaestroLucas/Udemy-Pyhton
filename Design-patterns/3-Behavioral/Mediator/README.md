# Mediator

Lets u reduce chaotic dependecies between objects. The pattern restricts direct
communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a
mediator object.

    Suggests that u should cease all direct communication between the componets.

        All the logic goes to the mediator classes/interfaces.
